## Haydn London Symphonies ##

The Later London Symphonies
(Symphonies 99 to 104)
by Franz Joseph Haydn


Haydn's so-called "London Symphonies" include a dozen orchestral works
commissioned by Johann Peter Salomon for performances in London.  The
symphonies were composed between 1791 and 1795 -- and their performances
led to critical acclaim and considerable financial success for Haydn.
The London Symphonies include many of Haydn's most popular orchestral
works, including the "Drum Roll," "The Military," and "The Clock"
symphonies.

This electronic edition of the last six of the London Symphonies
(Nos. 99 to 104) has been produced by the Center for Computer Assisted
Research in the Humanities.  The accompanying files were prepared from
the Eulenburg edition (n.d.) published in London, and edited by Ernst
Praetorius.  Symphony No. 100 was edited by H.C. Robbins Landon.
(A reprint of this edition of the later London Symphonies is available
from Dover Publications of New York: ISBN 0-486-24983-2.)

Machine transcription, proof reading, and proof listening was done
by Frances Bennion under the supervision of Dr. Eleanor Selfridge-Field.
Translation to the Humdrum `**kern` format was carried out by Dr.
David Huron using software developed by Kyle Dawkins.  Music entry
and editing was done using the [dmuse](https://dmuse.ccarh.org)
facilities designed and implemented by Dr. Walter Hewlett.

A detailed description of the `**kern` representation format is given in
the accompanying file "kern_hlp.txt".
